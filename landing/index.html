              They say they delete it. Some probably do. But why risk your sensitive audio data?

              We built <strong>TIHKH</strong> because we needed transcription we could trust. 
              Everything runs locally using WebAssembly and <strong>OpenAI's Whisper AI model</strong> — 
              the same technology powering premium transcription services, but completely private.

        <h2 id="faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions About Free Audio Transcription</h2>
        
        <dl class="faq-list">
          <dt>Is the transcription service actually free?</dt>
          <dd>Yes, completely free. No trial period, no credit card, no hidden fees. Since all transcription processing runs in your browser, we have no server costs to pass on to you. <strong>Transcriber I Hardly Knew Her</strong> is free forever.</dd>
          
          <dt>How accurate is the AI transcription?</dt>
          <dd>We use <strong>OpenAI's Whisper model</strong> — the same AI technology powering most premium paid transcription services. Transcription accuracy is comparable to services charging $10-30/month.</dd>
          
          <dt>What audio file formats are supported?</dt>
          <dd>TIHKH supports <strong>MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, WebM</strong>, and most common audio formats. You can also record audio directly in your browser using your microphone.</dd>
          
          <dt>Does audio transcription work offline?</dt>
          <dd>Yes! After the first use (when the browser downloads the 75MB Whisper AI model), transcription works <strong>100% offline</strong>. No internet connection required.</dd>
          
          <dt>Where is my transcription data stored?</dt>
          <dd>All data is stored locally in your browser's IndexedDB. You can export or delete your transcripts anytime. We literally cannot access your data — it never leaves your device.</dd>
          
          <dt>Is this transcription HIPAA compliant?</dt>
          <dd>Since no audio data ever leaves your browser, there's no server-side storage or transmission to worry about. Your audio recordings and transcripts remain entirely on your local device, making it ideal for healthcare providers who need to maintain patient privacy.</dd>
          
          <dt>Can I self-host this transcription app?</dt>
          <dd>Absolutely. <strong>Transcriber I Hardly Knew Her</strong> is open source under the MIT License. Clone the repository from GitHub and run it on your own infrastructure.</dd>
          
          <dt>Does transcription work on mobile devices?</dt>
          <dd>Yes, TIHKH works on mobile browsers. On devices with <strong>WebGPU support</strong>, you can use local transcription. Otherwise, use <strong>server-side transcription</strong> for fast, accurate results without taxing your device.</dd>
          
          <dt>How long does transcription take?</dt>
          <dd>With <strong>WebGPU acceleration</strong>, expect near real-time processing on modern devices. Without GPU, roughly <strong>1-2 minutes of processing per minute of audio</strong>. <strong>Server-side transcription</strong> is consistently fast regardless of your device.</dd>
          
          <dt>How do you make money if it's free?</dt>
          <dd>We don't — this is a passion project built for ourselves and shared with the community. We may add optional paid features in the future, but the core transcription functionality will always remain free.</dd>
